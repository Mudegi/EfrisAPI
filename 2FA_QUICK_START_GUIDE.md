# 🔐 Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) - Quick Start Guide

## What is 2FA?

Two-Factor Authentication adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring:
1. **Your password** (something you know)
2. **Your phone** (something you have)

Even if someone steals your password, they cannot access your account without your phone.

## 💡 Tips for Effective Client Briefing

### Do's:
✅ Start with the "why" (risk/threat) before the "how" (2FA process)  
✅ Use real-world examples relevant to their industry  
✅ Demonstrate live in portal while explaining  
✅ Provide written materials for reference  
✅ Offer hands-on setup assistance  
✅ Follow up within 3-5 days  

### Don'ts:
❌ Use technical jargon without explanation  
❌ Focus only on features without benefits  
❌ Make it sound optional (it's critical)  
❌ Overwhelm with too much info at once  
❌ Forget to address their specific concerns  
❌ Skip the follow-up after initial briefing
